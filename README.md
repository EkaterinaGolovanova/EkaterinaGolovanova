- 👋 Hi, I’m @EkaterinaGolovanova
- 👀 I’m interested in software development in Python
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my personal web app with the plant's knowledge-base and functionality to keep track of plants' life cycle. I use Python, Django, and SQLite3 for back-end development and some bootstrap to make the app look more user-friendly. 
- 💞️ I’m currently looking for internship opportunities or a fill-time job.
- 📫 You can reach me anytime in LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/kategolovanova/
